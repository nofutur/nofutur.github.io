I am a graduate student in the **Evolutionary Genomics Group** at [Center for Genomic Regulation](www.crg.eu) in Barcelona, Spain. I am broadly interested in understanding the role of epistasis in short- and long-term evolution. 

### Current research projects:

* Functional interchangeability between alternative splicing and gene duplication
* Ohno's gene duplication under compensatory evolution framework
