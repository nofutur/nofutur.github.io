I am a graduate student in the **Evolutionary Genomics Group** at [Center for Genomic Regulation] (www.crg.eu) in Barcelona, Spain. I am broadly interested in understanding the role of epistasis in short- and long-term evolution. 

## Some of the questions that I study:

* Evolutionary aspects of epistasis on the short-term evolution (within population genetic variation)
* Structural constraints
* To what extent epistasis is important for long-term evolution
