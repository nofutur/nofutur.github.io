I am a graduate student in the **Evolutionary Genomics Group** at [Center for Genomic Regulation](www.crg.eu) in Barcelona, Spain. 

#### Research

I am broadly interested in understanding the role of epistasis in short- and long-term evolution. Current research projects include: 

* Functional interchangeability between alternative splicing and gene duplication
* Ohno's gene duplication model under compensatory evolution framework
